Windows Defender Exploit Guard - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection

The four components of Windows Defender Exploit Guard are:
	• Attack Surface Reduction (ASR): A set of controls that enterprises can enable to prevent malware from getting on the machine by blocking Office-, script-, and email-based threats    
	• Network protection: Protects the endpoint against web-based threats by blocking any outbound process on the device to untrusted hosts/IP through Windows Defender SmartScreen
	• Controlled folder access: Protects sensitive data from ransomware by blocking untrusted processes from accessing your protected folders
	• Exploit protection: A set of exploit mitigations (replacing EMET) that can be easily configured to protect your system and applications
